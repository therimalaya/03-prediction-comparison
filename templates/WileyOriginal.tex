\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is a generic template designed for use by multiple journals, which includes several options for customization. Please consult the author guidelines for the journal to which you are submitting in order to confirm that your manuscript will comply with the journal's requirements. Please replace this text with your abstract.

% Please include a maximum of seven keywords
\keywords{keyword 1, \emph{keyword 2}, keyword 3, keyword 4, keyword 5, keyword 6, keyword 7}
\end{abstract}

\section{First Level Heading}
Please lay out your article using the section headings and example objects below, and remember to delete all help text prior to submitting your article to the journal.

\begin{figure}[bt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{example-image-rectangle}
\caption{Although we encourage authors to send us the highest-quality figures possible, for peer-review purposes we are can accept a wide variety of formats, sizes, and resolutions. Legends should be concise but comprehensive – the figure and its legend must be understandable without reference to the text. Include definitions of any symbols used and define/explain all abbreviations and units of measurement.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Second Level Heading}
If data, scripts or other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the article are available via a publicly available data repository, please include a reference to the location of the material within the article.

% Equations should be inserted using standard LaTeX equation and eqnarray environments, not as graphics, and should be set in the main text
This is an equation, numbered
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{+\infty}e^{-x^2}dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\end{equation}
And one that is not numbered
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\pi}=-1
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Adding Citations and a References List}

Please use a \verb|.bib| file to store your references. When using Overleaf to prepare your manuscript, you can upload a \verb|.bib| file or import your Mendeley, CiteULike or Zotero library directly as a \verb|.bib| file\footnote{see \url{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}}. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{lees2010theoretical}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

You can find a video tutorial here to learn more about BibTeX: \url{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}.

This template provides two options for the citation and reference list style: 
\begin{description}
\item[Numerical style] Use \verb|\documentclass[...,num-refs]{wiley-article}|
\item[Author-year style] Use \verb|\documentclass[...,alpha-refs]{wiley-article}|
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Third Level Heading}
Supporting information will be included with the published article. For submission any supporting information should be supplied as separate files but referred to in the text.

Appendices will be published after the references. For submission they should be supplied as separate files but referred to in the text.

\paragraph{Fourth Level Heading}
% Here are examples of quotes and epigraphs.
\begin{quote}
The significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them.\endnote{Albert Einstein said this.}
\end{quote}

\begin{epigraph}{Albert Einstein}
Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.
\end{epigraph}

\subparagraph{Fifth level heading}
Measurements should be given in SI or SI-derived units.
Chemical substances should be referred to by the generic name only. Trade names should not be used. Drugs should be referred to by their generic names. If proprietary drugs have been used in the study, refer to these by their generic name, mentioning the proprietary name, and the name and location of the manufacturer, in parentheses.

\begin{table}[bt]
\caption{This is a table. Tables should be self-contained and complement, but not duplicate, information contained in the text. They should be not be provided as images. Legends should be concise but comprehensive – the table, legend and footnotes must be understandable without reference to the text. All abbreviations must be defined in footnotes.}
\begin{threeparttable}
\begin{tabular}{lccrr}
