# Discussions and Conclusion

On one hand, the envelope methods have shown better prediction performance with fewer number of components. However, for data with high multicollinearity, the methods have shown some cases of unstable prediction. Here for the prediction error, we have used the components that give the minimum average prediction error for all replicates. This hints that for some replicates, the methods has used non-optimal number of components and consequently resulting in high prediction error. The two examples in the previous section collaborate with this point.

On the other hand, PLS1, PLS2 and PCR methods have smaller prediction error in the model with high multicollinearity which suggest their robustness in the particular case. However, they have shown poor performance in modelling information at relevant components with small variance. These methods have used larger number of components, in general, than envelopes. Although resulting higher prediction error than envelope methods in most situations, these methods are more stable especially in the cases of high multicollinearity.

Further, we have fixed the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) constant throughtout all the designs. Initial simulations (not shown) indicated that low $R^2$ affect all methods in similar manner and the MANOVA is hightly dominated by $R^2$. Keeping the value of $R^2$ fixed has allowed us to analyze other factors properly.

Two clear comment can be made about the effect of correlation of response on the prediction methods. Highly correlated response has shown highest prediction error in general and the effect is distinct in envelope methods. Since the envelope methods identifies the relevant space as the span of relevant eigenvectors, the methods are able to obtain the minimum average prediction error by using fewer number of components for all levels of `eta`.

As of our knowledge, the effect of correlation in the response on PCR and PLS methods are less explored. In this regards, it is interesting to see that these methods have used large number of components and returned large prediction error than envelope methods in the case of highly correlated responses. In order to fully understand the effect of `eta`, it is necessary to study the estimation performance of these methods at different number of components.

In addition, since using principal components or actual variables as predictors in envelope methods have shown similar results, we have used principal components that have explained 97.5% of the variation as mentioned previously in the cases of envelope methods. As the envelope methods are based on MLE and this can be an alternative way of using the methods in data with wide predictors. The results from this study will help researcher to understand these methods for different nature of data. We encourage researcher to use newly developed methods such as envlope based on the nature of data they are working on.

Since, this study have focused entirely on prediction performance, further analysis of their estimative properties of these methods is required. A study of estimation error and the behaviour of methods on non-optimal number of components can give deeper understanding of these methods.
