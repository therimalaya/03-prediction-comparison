Highlights:

- A comparative study of prediction performance of multi-response multivariate linear regression
- Comparison is based on both simulated and real data
- Simultaneous envelope (Senv) and Envelope in predictor variable (Xenv) has shown stable prediction using fewer number of components than PCR and PLS methods
- Demonstrate how the simulation tool `simrel` can be used to construct complex models and experimental design for extensive comparison.
