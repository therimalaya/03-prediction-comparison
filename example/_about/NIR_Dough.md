The calibration set has $N=40$ samples of $p=700$ wavelengths (1100-2498nm in steps of 2nm). Four response variables yield _percentages of_ (a) _fat_, (b) _sucrose_, (c) _flour_ and (d) _water_ from measurements of biscuit dough. A separate test set contains 32 samples. The two sets were created and measured on different occasions. ([A twist to partial least squares regression](DOI: 10.1002/cem.904)).
